# Incubator IoT System 

 ## IoT System Overview

This project is an IoT-based Chicken Egg Incubator Monitoring System that leverages Raspberry Pi and AWS cloud services to provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring and controlling the incubation environment.

## Key Components and Workflow

1. **IoT Device (Raspberry Pi)**: 
   - The Raspberry Pi is equipped with a DHT11 sensor, which measures the temperature and humidity inside the incubator.
   - The sensor data is then published to AWS IoT Core.

2. **AWS IoT Core**:
   - AWS IoT Core serves as the central hub for collecting sensor data from the Raspberry Pi.
   - It securely processes the incoming data and triggers actions based on predefined rules.

3. **Data Storage (DynamoDB)**:
   - Sensor data received by AWS IoT Core is stored in DynamoDB, a NoSQL database that offers fast and flexible data retrieval.

4. **AWS Lambda**:
   - AWS Lambda functions are used to automatically process the incoming data from AWS IoT Core and store it in DynamoDB.
   - Lambda functions can also trigger automated actions based on the sensor readings, such as turning on a fan or adjusting a heating element.

5. **Subscriber for Automated Actions**:
   - The system includes a subscriber that listens to updates from the DHT11 sensor via AWS IoT Core. 
   - It automatically triggers actions such as controlling the temperature and humidity inside the incubator, ensuring an optimal environment for the eggs.

6. **Next.js Dashboard**:
   - A monitoring dashboard is built using Next.js to visualize the real-time data.
   - The dashboard allows users to monitor the incubator environment, watch live video feeds, and manually control the incubator's components.

This integrated solution provides a reliable and scalable approach to managing and monitoring egg incubation, ensuring that environmental conditions are maintained within optimal ranges automatically and with minimal human intervention.

### 2. Algorithm Design

The following table outlines the automatic triggering algorithm for maintaining optimal temperature and humidity levels during the incubation process. The algorithm adjusts the environmental conditions based on the day of the incubation period.

#### Temperature Settings

| Days                | Temperature      |
|---------------------|------------------|
| From 1-7 of days    | 37.8째C           |
| From 8-18 of days   | 37.6째C           |
| From 19-21 of days  | 37.2째C           |

#### Humidity Settings

| Days                | Humidity         |
|---------------------|------------------|
| From 1-5 of days    | 60-61% = 60.5%   |
| From 6-11 of days   | 55-57% = 56%     |
| From 12-18 of days  | 50-53% = 51.5%   |
| From 19 of days     | 60%              |
| From 20-21 of days  | 70-75%           |

This algorithm ensures that the incubator maintains the optimal environment for egg incubation, adjusting the temperature and humidity levels at critical stages in the incubation cycle.
